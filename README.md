# UtilPenguin
A rather simple helper util for the international version of CHUNITHM-NET (https://chunithm-net-eng.com/mobile/home/)

## Functionalities
This util currently supports nothing. 
There are two functions that are to be integrated:

- ShopHelper: Alters the shop page, granting the user purchase an arbitrary number of products as needed.
- TeamRankFixer: Fixes the team course ranking page, which is currently not being sorted properly. (as of 2024-05-05)

The two functions above already exist as a standalone JS snippet, though.

## Roadmap

* Make basic UI
* Integrate ShopHelper
* Integrate TeamRankFixer (if team course is still broken)
* Enhance ShopHelper to scout for the player's current item count, and set the purchasable amount accordingly.
  * (A player cannot have more than 99 tickets of a sort; this enhancement will prevent the user from buying more than this max amount)
* (TBA)

## How do I use this?
```

Simply paste the text above onto your address bar. 

If you are using the tool while inside the CHUNITHM-NET site, the tool will spawn a selection prompt that provides functionalities for the current location.

If you are using the tool while _NOT_ inside CHUNITHM-NET, the tool will ask if the user would like to go to CHUNITHM-NET. 

This tool is expected to work on most browsers based off of Chromium.
This includes but is not limited to:
* Google Chrome (Stable, Beta, Canary)
* Mozilla Firefox
* Opera
* Microsoft Edge

Note that browsers not listed here are not tested and may not work as 100% intended.
In this case, send an inquiry to the developer and let them know.
